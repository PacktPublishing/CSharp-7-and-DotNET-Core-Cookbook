## About the Book
C# has recently been open-sourced and C# 7 comes with a host of new features for building powerful, cross-platform applications.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 12 doesn't have any code.

The code will look like the following:
```
public override void Initialize(AnalysisContext context)
{
  context.RegisterSymbolAction(AnalyzeSymbol,
  SymbolKind.NamedType);
}
```

You will need the latest version of Visual Studio 2017. For some of the chapters on mobile development, you will need an active Apple iTunes account. Regarding the last chapter, you will need to create a free AWS account. Lastly, some of the recipes might also require access to the Azure portal.
